# Moodle Drip Course Format

**Unlock Learning, One Step at a Time!**

The _Drip Course Format_ plugin for Moodle offers a dynamic way to manage course progression by automatically releasing content over time based on each learner's enrollment date. This ensures learners stay engaged without being overwhelmed, making it ideal for structured programs such as compliance training or blended learning environments.

With the Drip course format, content is gradually 'dripped out' over time, with an email notification sent to the learner within 24 hours of a new section becoming available.

## Key Features
- **Automated Dripping**: Seamlessly unlock new sections relative to the enrollment start date.
- **Customizable Intervals**: Set drip schedules tailored to each course.
- **Enhanced Engagement**: Drip pacing helps maintain focus and prevent overload.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Integrated with Moodleâ€™s course index for clean, intuitive navigation.

## Use Cases
- **Compliance Training**: Ensure learners progress through courses sequentially.
- **Blended Learning**: Release digital content over time to complement face-to-face sessions.
- **Onboarding Programs**: Gradually introduce learners to essential training material over weeks.

## Installation
1. Place the plugin in `<YourMoodleFolder>/course/format/drip/`.
2. Log in as an admin and complete the plugin installation through the Moodle interface.

## Configuration
- Set custom drip intervals for each course.
- Define the starting section for content release.
